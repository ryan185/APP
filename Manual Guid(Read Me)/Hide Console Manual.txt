Let’s say we have a file named syncfiles.bat in C:\Batch Files directory. Let’s launch it in hidden mode using Windows Scripting.

1. Copy the following lines to Notepad.
		Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
		WshShell.Run chr(34) & "C:\Batch Files\syncfiles.bat" & Chr(34), 0
		Set WshShell = Nothing
Note: Replace the batch file name/path accordingly in the script according to your requirement.

2. Save the file with .VBS extension, say launch_bat.vbs
3. Edit the .BAT file name and path accordingly, and save the file.
4. Double-click to run the launch_bat.vbs file, which in-turn launches the batch file syncfiles.bat invisibly.
